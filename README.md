# Diabetes-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

As the name suggests this Machine Learning project is used to detect Diabetics. 
Diabetes Dataset taken from Kaggle consists of 768 instances, 8 features and target attribute consist of either tested_positive or tested_negative value. 
Machine Learning Algorithm used in this projects are Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine(SVM) and K Nearest Neighbors(KNN). 
This Project has an accuracy around 75%-80%, with Random Forest and KNN having highest accuracy.
